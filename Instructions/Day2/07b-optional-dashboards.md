*If you want to use Power Automate to trigger additional actions, first you need to save the alert, and then click manage alerts on the tile*


## **Refresh the Dataset**

In this exercise, we will simulate data refresh. You'll update the dataset to point to another database, which includes sales order data for June 2020. You'll then open your Power BI Desktop file, change the datasource, and then upload the file to your workspace.

1. Open your file in PowerBI desktop

1. In top menu, under Transform Data select **Data source setting**

1. Select **lglobal.database.windows.net...** and Click **Change Source**. Type **AdventureWorksDW2020_Updated** in the database field. click OK and Close.
